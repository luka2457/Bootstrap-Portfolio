                    <p class="col-10-sm"> I grew up in Shorewood Minnesota and moved to Colorado about seven years ago. I have been working in
                        the medical field for the last 4 years and that is where I developed an interest in coding. I have
                        worked at various hospitals over those years, which has allowed me to interact with many different
                        electronic medical record softwares. Throughout all of these softwares, I always felt that there
                        should be an easier way to document. With artificial inteligence branching out over all areas of
                        technology, I think it is only a matter of time until AI revolutionizes EMR's. I believe that AI
                        can expidite patient charting in so many ways not yet discovered. Not only will AI cause EMR charting
                        to be more timely efficent but it will also provide a higher level of patient safety and even contribute
                        to researching unknown and not yet curable diseases. Working my way up to the frontier of AI is just
                        one goal on my growing list. From just two weeks of extremely enter level coding that list has skyrocket.
                        I am extremely excited to get to some of the good stuff and break in to JavaScript. Cheers!</p>
